# lua-tarantool-set

**lua-tarantool-set** is a wrapper library for Tarantool like [lua-resty-set](https://github.com/emyasnikov/lua-resty-set) for OpenResty which tries to simplify the complexity of the framework.

## CRUD

**lua-tarantool-set** supports predefined CRUD endpoints, which can be used to shorten code. This only works with appropriate ID provided while registering new Set:

```lua
local Example = set("example")
```

### Create

```lua
Example:create(function(self, data) end)
```

This matches `POST /example` and reads data to `data`.

### Read

```lua
Example:read(function(self, id) end)
```

This matches `GET /example/1`.

### Update

```lua
Example:update(function(self, id, data) end)
```

This matches `PATCH /example/1` and reads data to `data`.

### Delete

```lua
Example:delete(function(self, id) end)
```

And this matches `DELETE /example/1`.

## Routes

```lua
Example:route('get', '/example/:id', function(self)
  local id = tonumber(http:stash("id"))
  if not id then return self.error(400, "http.bad_request") end
  return {}
end)
```

Route function takes method and path with named attributes in it, like the ID in this case.
